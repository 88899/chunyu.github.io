I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago, fortunate to be advised by Prof. Philip S. Yu. 

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my M.S. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh, where I had the valuable opportunity to work with Prof. Frank Keller. I completed my undergraduate studies with a B.S. in Electronic Information from Xidian University.
